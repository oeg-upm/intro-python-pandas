In this dynamic web-based document you can write not only text, but also Python code that can be executed.\n","\n","* ***Colab*** or \"Colaboratory\" is Google's service to use notebooks. You can think of Colab as notebooks stored in Google Drive. With Colab you can easily write, run and share notebooks.\n","\n","* ***Pandas*** is Python's Swiss Army knife for processing tabular data.
